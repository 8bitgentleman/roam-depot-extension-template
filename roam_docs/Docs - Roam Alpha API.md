- **Getting Started**
    - The Roam Alpha API is provided in the browser allowing you to read and write data as well as manipulate the UI
        - The [methods](((dNU0WDE7Z))) available in the API are attached to the `window` object in the browser under `roamAlphaAPI`
        - You can see a list of [examples](((67fQxAG7O))) below, showcasing the amazing things that can be built using this API, especially when used in combination with [[roam/js]]
        - To learn how to use the API, there are some [awesome articles](((EDQKoL49J))) written by our community
- (for the cljs version of the Roam Alpha API, please checkout the [[Reference]] section of [[roam/cljs]])

    - methods::
        - `window.roamAlphaAPI`
            - `.data`
                - `.q`
                    - Description::
                        - Query the graph using datomic flavored datalog
                        - See the [datomic docs](https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query/query.html) for a full explanation of datalog queries
                            - Or http://www.learndatalogtoday.org learn how to write them
                            - [Datascript tests](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/tree/master/test/datascript/test) also include great examples
                        - `q`, `pull`, and variant API functions now have a timeout of 20 seconds
                            - Throws an error with message `Query and/or pull expression took too long to run.` when you run into the timeout limit
                    - Parameters::
                        - `query`
                            - Type::
                                - String
                        - `& args`
                    - Example::
                        - ```javascript
                          window.roamAlphaAPI.data.q(
                            `[:find ?b ?s
                              :where 
                              [?e :block/uid ?b]
                              [?e :block/string ?s]]`);
                          ```
                            - Find a relation of all block uids and strings in the graph
                - `.pull`
                    - Description::
                        - A declarative way to make hierarchical (and possibly nested) selections of information about entities. Pull applies a `pattern` to a collection of entities, building a map for each entity.
                        - See for the [datomic docs](https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query/pull.html) for a good explanation of how to use pull
                            - There are slight differences because we use [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) internally, but it supports the majority of datomic syntax
                            - The main difference is the JS API the pattern is written in a string instead of clojure data structures
                        - `q`, `pull`, and variant API functions now have a timeout of 20 seconds
                            - Throws an error with message `Query and/or pull expression took too long to run.` when you run into the timeout limit
                    - Parameters::
                        - `pattern`
                            - Type::
                                - String
                            - Examples::
                                - `"[*]"`
                                - `"[:block/string {:block/children ...}]"`
                        - `eid`
                            - [[OR]]
                                - a database id `:db/id`
                                    - Type::
                                        - Integer
                                    - Example::
                                        - `24`
                                - an entity unique identifier
                                    - Type::
                                        - String | 2-tuple array
                                    - Example::
                                        - `"[:node/title \"hello world\"]"`
                                        - `[":block/uid", "xyz"]`
                    - Example::
                        - ```javascript
                          window.roamAlphaAPI.data.pull("[*]", [":block/uid", "xyz"])
                          ```
                            - Get all of the attributes for this block
                        - `window.roamAlphaAPI.data.pull("[:block/string {:block/children ...}]", "[:block/uid \"xyz\"]")`
                            - Get the block string for this block and all it's children
                - `.pull_many`
                    - Description::
                        - Same as `.pull` but for multiple entities
                            - May be faster for pulling many entities at the same time
                        - `q`, `pull`, and variant API functions now have a timeout of 20 seconds
                            - Throws an error with message `Query and/or pull expression took too long to run.` when you run into the timeout limit
                    - Parameters::
                        - `pattern`
                            - Same as pull's `pattern`
                        - `eids`
                            - an array of `eid`s
                    - Example::
                        - `roamAlphaAPI.data.pull_many("[*]", [[":block/uid", "_fM7pkQEa"], [":block/uid", "kZHsZniZs"]]);`
                - `.fast`
                    - Description::
                        - Functions underneath `.fast` use experimental clojurescript to javascript conversion to speed up read access. They tend to be around 33% faster and more comparable to running it in pure clojurescript.
                        - Functions accept the same parameters as their regular peers
                        - Functions return a cljs object wrapped in a js [proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
                            - This object should be treated as **read only**
                                - and may not print to the console correctly
                            - Map/object access may be different
                                - Key access will by default include the full namespaced key like this
                                    - `obj[":block/string"]`
                                        - This proxies to the cljs keyword `:block/string`
                                    - but if you renamed the key in a pull
                                        - Like this `"[:block/string :as "string"]"`
                                        - Then it should be able to be accessed like this
                                            - `obj.string`
                            - For a deeper explanation of how this works internally and the trade offs see https://blog.wsscode.com/alternative-to-clj-js/
                        - `q`, `pull`, and variant API functions now have a timeout of 20 seconds
                            - Throws an error with message `Query and/or pull expression took too long to run.` when you run into the timeout limit
                    - functions::
                        - `.q`
                - `.async`
                    - Description::
                        - The functions under `.async` are equivalent to the non async versions, except they return promises.
                        - Eventually Roam will migrate to the async API and the sync functions will be deprecated, **if you are building a new extension you should prefer using these to avoid migrating in the future.**
                    - `.q`
                    - `.pull`
                    - `.pull_many`
                    - `.fast`
                        - `.q`
                - `.backend`
                    - Description::
                        - The functions under `.backend` (currently only `q`) run against the backend (off thread). 
                        - This could be useful if you have an expensive query to run.
                        - If the backend doesn't exist for a graph or it's unavailable (encrypted or offline), then it will default to running locally.
                        - **Warning**: The backend could be a few changes behind the frontend if changes are still syncing
                    - `.q`
                - `.addPullWatch`
                    - Description::
                        - Watches for changes on pull patterns on blocks and pages and provides a callback to execute after changes are recorded, providing the before and after state to operate on
                    - Parameters::
                        - pull pattern
                            - {{[[TODO]]}} 
                            - __string__
                            - Required
                        - entity-id
                            - {{[[TODO]]}} 
                            - __string__
                            - Required
                        - callback function
                            - Takes two arguments, before and after state of the pull
                            - __function__
                            - Required
                    - Returns::
                        - Promise which resolves once operation has completed
                            - More details [here](((CMKX2Zpwl)))
                    - Usage::
                        - ```javascript
                          window
                            .roamAlphaAPI
                            .data

                            - if `selection` is not present, defaults to placing the cursor at the end of the string
                            - if `end`  is specified, it becomes a selection, otherwise it becomes a cursor placement before the `start`  element (0-indexed)

                                - if `selection` is present, `start`  is mandatory
                                - if `end`  is specified, it becomes a selection, otherwise it becomes a cursor placement before the `start`  element (0-indexed)
                                - if  `end`  is less than `start` , then both are treated as the value of `end`

                                            - An example of a native hotkey like that is `["ctrl-c", "ctrl-m"]` for going to next block
                                        - limit is 5 
                                - if this has not been provided but `disable-hotkey` is absent or false, no hotkey is set up but user can customize it from settings. **So, most commands should NOT have default-hotkey** 
                                - user can customize this from the "Hotkeys" menu

                            - Adds a menu item to the [[Block Context Menu]] (what comes up if you right click on the bullet of a single block), and calls the provided callback when the user selects that command.
                            - All custom commands are nested under the Plugins menu item.
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fdeveloper-documentation%2Fa87mH7hqIQ.png?alt=media&token=b9dcb514-470c-44fb-8f32-f6b8f11cc7ce)
                            - If called again with the same `label`, will not add a second command, but will update the first command with the new callback.
                            - You can optionally provide a conditional function, which runs every time the menu is opened, with context about the current block, and returns a boolean of whether this menu item should be included for this particular block.

                            - `label`: __string__

                                    - Should preferably include a plugin prefix to ensure global uniqueness if user has more than one plugin installed
                                        - for example `"RoamRS: Start review session"`
                            - `display-conditional`: __function__, optional
                                - Function called with `block-context` which should return true if the command should be shown or false if not.

                    - `addCallback`
                        - Description::
                            - Adds a callback that gets called whenever a graph view is loaded. There are two types of graph views - "all-pages" (the entire database) and "page" (a specific page and its components). Using the optional `type` parameter, you can request to only trigger callbacks on a specific type of graphs.
                            - The graph view is rendered using [[Cytoscape]], and by exposing the Cytoscape object, we hope to enable experimentation with various Cytoscape plugins, alternative UIs, etc.
                        - Parameters::
                            - `label`
                                - String label used to upsert or remove listener
                                - __string__
                            - `callback`
                                - Function called with `context` when the user selects the command in the Command Palette
                                - `context`:
                                    - `cytoscape` holds a reference to the [[Cytoscape]] graph object
                                    - `elements` is an array of the nodes and edges in the graph
                                    - `type` is "page" | "all-pages"

                - `.corsAnywhereProxyUrl`
                    - (added on [[November 23rd, 2024]])
                    - the url for a [CORS-anywhere proxy](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) hosted by the Roam team
                    - This can be useful when you're querying an external API in your extension but it has CORS restrictions
                    - **How to use it**
                        - pretty easy, instead of `fetch`ing the `url`, instead fetch (`roamAlphaAPI.constants.corsAnywhereProxyUrl` + "/" + `url`)
                        - Some sample JS code
                            - ```javascript
                              let urlToFetch = "https://google.com"
                              
                              await fetch(`${roamAlphaAPI.constants.corsAnywhereProxyUrl}/${urlToFetch}`)
                                .then(a=>a.text())
                              ```
                        - Note that to prevent misuse, this proxy only works when the request originates from Roam domains `https://roamresearch.com`
